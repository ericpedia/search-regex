Search Regex adds a powerful set of search and replace functions to WordPress that go beyond the standard searching capabilities, with full regex support.

== Description ==

Search Regex adds a powerful set of search and replace functions to WordPress. These go beyond the standard searching capabilities, and allow you to search and replace almost any data stored on your site. In addition to simple searches you have the full power of PHP's regular expressions at your disposal.

The driving force behind this plugin is to aid in website migration and upgrading. If you've ever done either of these then you know the pain of having to go back through all your data, changing URL paths and fixing things. With this plugin you can reduce this work to a search and replace pattern and the job is finished in seconds.

Why would you want this? The primary reason for the plugin was to aid in relocating directories. It's a real pain to manually go through every post and change image directory names. With this plugin all that was required was a simple search and replace pattern, and the job was finished in a few seconds.

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `search-regex.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload `audit-trail` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin
1. Configure the plugin from `Management/Search Regex`
